Sir we have uploaded both the main folder which contains our run file (changes in simple assembler) and my Assembler.java is also there in SimpleAssembler folder. 


We did our hole assignment in "JAVA" language but it was being very difficult for us to plot the graph in java itself(Though we did it),we are attaching that file as well named as "Plot_java" but after thinking again we thought we dont know if its correct or not so in the session held on 20 August 2021, Setu Gupta Sir himself said that even if you have done the whole assignment in java you may plot graph in python so we created another file "Write.java" which is taking the normal input same as "Simulator.java" and its writing the output in a text file and then in "PYTHON", we are using the same text file in which the output was written for plotting the graph using Matplotlib.

I have uploaded a complete folder containg all the files seperately and in the "Simple_Assembler" and "Simple_Assembler" Folder too.

The name of the folder for the simultor part hich has each and every file is "CO_M21_Assignment-main_With_simulator"

Also i have seperatedly uploaded the same Assembler.java file.

Please take a look.

Please advice if any further action is required on our part
